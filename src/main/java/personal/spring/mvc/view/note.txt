What’s internal resource views?
In Spring MVC or any web application, for good practice, it’s always recommended to put the entire views or JSP files under “WEB-INF” folder,
to protect it from direct access via manual entered URL. Those views under “WEB-INF” folder are named as internal resource views,
as it’s only accessible by the servlet or Spring’s controllers class.
