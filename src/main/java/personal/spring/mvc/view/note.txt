If you want suffix determine the view, ContentNegotiatingViewResolver is the choice.

What’s internal resource views?
In Spring MVC or any web application, for good practice, it’s always recommended to put the entire views or JSP files under “WEB-INF” folder,
to protect it from direct access via manual entered URL. Those views under “WEB-INF” folder are named as internal resource views,
as it’s only accessible by the servlet or Spring’s controllers class.
