two interface:
ViewResolver and View.

There are 2 types of challenge in view generation:
1. for jsp, jstl, etc., the basic problem is how to map your view name to the jsp to generate it, here, the ViewResolver comes,
the ViewResolver including url based, xml, resource bundle deal with this part.
2. generating different view according to different input, the content negotiating deal with this part.


What’s internal resource views?
In Spring MVC or any web application, for good practice, it’s always recommended to put the entire views or JSP files under “WEB-INF” folder,
to protect it from direct access via manual entered URL. Those views under “WEB-INF” folder are named as internal resource views,
as it’s only accessible by the servlet or Spring’s controllers class.
