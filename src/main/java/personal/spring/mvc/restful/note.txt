How to generate application.wadl file for spring mvc project.

https://javattitude.com/2014/05/26/wadl-generator-for-spring-rest/

to make this code work, you should configure (register) RequestMappingHandlerMapping by MVC Java Config, or XML namespace.

you can see the RequestMappingHandlerMapping registered in context or not by
1. toggle <mvc:annotation-driven/> in spring-servlet.xml
2. access the page: http://localhost:8080/spring-mvc/spring/hello
3. check log in console.


You define @XmlRootElement and @XmlAccessType only on Person.class
You don't need them on Address.class

If you want the api can return xml and Json, you should annotate it with Xml annotation, and add jackson-databind dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.0</version>
</dependency>

Note, to let Json working, the model object should have public accessor.

And, the above maven only make the project output json information, but, it is not means you can customize the json property by JAXB annotation
like in jersey. you have to add @JsonProperty("") annotation to make it happens.

@JsonProperty are comming from above maven dependency.

the InternalResourceViewResolver is not used when using @RestController.

it seems that to make @RestController works, you have to use
<mvc:annotation-driven/>

Please note, if you have root context and servlet context, don't let your component scan have overlapped each other.
Otherwise, <mvc:annotation-driven/> may not work.
